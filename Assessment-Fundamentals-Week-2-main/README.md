# Tau Labs

Welcome to Tau Labs! We are a high performance team of data scientists and engineers who are passionate about solving the world's most challenging problems with data. We are a team of 10,000+ members and we are growing every day.

In this challenge you'll be building out our assessment framework. We have a number of different assessments that we use to assess candidates and we need to be able to run these assessments and store the results.

## Setup

Please ensure you do every step below carefully. Not doing so will mean we can't assess your work and **will result in a score of zero**.

1. Create a repo named exactly `Assessment-Fundamentals-Week-2`
2. Invite your coaches to it (they'll let you know they Github usernames)
3. Push all the code in this folder to your created repository
4. On your created repo, click on `Actions` in the top menu bar
   - If it's there, click on `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them`
5. Complete the assessment
6. Commit & push your code regularly

Before running your code, run this command

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Files Explained

In each of the `Level` folders you will find the code and instructions for that level. **Each level will build on the one before it**; be sure to read the instructions carefully.

- `task_[level].py` - All of your code should be written in this file.
- `test_[level]_task.py` - This file contains some basic tasks for this level. You should also add your own tests here
- `README.md` - This file contains the instructions for the level.
- `test_[level]_assessment.py` - **This file is encrypted.** It contains additional tests for this level that are used as part of the assessment. **You should not modify this file.**
